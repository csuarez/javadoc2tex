# javadoc2tex

This is an extended version of TexGen Doclet, which has new two options. I've developed these options for my personal use, but I decided to publish it.

This version is distributed under the same conditions than TexGen (see ORIGINAL-README file).

## New options

* Output in Spanish language using the `spanish` option.
* Adding a new level for the initial element of the hierarchy: subsubsection. This can be used specifying the `subsubsection` option.
